	<h3>WHAT IS PATINTERO?</h3>
	<p>Patintero is a traditional Filipino street game that involves two teams: one team tries to run across a grid without getting tagged (Offensive Team), while the other team tries to guard the lines and tag the runners (Defensive Team). It’s known for its fast-paced action, teamwork, and strategic movement.</p>

	<h4>HOW TO PLAY PATINTERO (THE CLASSIC RULE)?</h4>
	<ol type ="1">
    <li>Draw a rectangle on the ground and divide it with lines (like a grid).</li>
    <li>Make two teams runners and taggers.</li>
    <li>Taggers stand on the lines and try to tag the runners.</li>
    <li>Runners try to cross to the other end and come back without getting tagged.</li>
    <li>If one runner makes it all the way and returns, their team wins right away!</li>
    <li>If any runner gets tagged, the team loses, and it’s the other team’s turn.</li>
    </ol> <br>

    <h3>TIPS & TRICKS TO DO</h3>
    <div class="tips-table">
    <div class="column">
    <h4>Runners</h4>
    <ul type ="square">
    <li><strong>Feinting (Fake-Out Moves)</strong><br>
    	How to do it: Pretend to run in one direction to lure the guard, then quickly switch direction.<br>
        When to use: Use when a guard is closely watching you or guarding a specific lane.</li>
    <li><strong>Sudden Stop and Dash</strong><br>
    	How to do it: Run toward a guard and then stop suddenly to bait them into tagging early, then quickly dash the other way.<br>
        When to use: Best used against aggressive guards who try to tag too early.</li>
    <li><strong>Distraction Trick (Team Play)</strong><br>
    	How to do it: One runner draws the guard’s attention by moving near them, while another sneaks past on the opposite side.<br>
        When to use: Great for coordinated team plays to get at least one player across the line.</li>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
    <h4>Taggers</h4>
    <ul type ="square">
    <li><strong>Fake Moves</strong><br>
    	How to do it: Step a little toward one side like you’re blocking it, then quickly switch back or tag the other side.<br>
        When to use: Use when the runner is trying to confuse or outsmart you. It throws them off.</li>
    <li><strong>Stay in the Middle (For the vertical line guard)</strong><br>
    	How to do it: Stand near the center of the vertical line. Watch both ends. Move left or right only when needed.<br>
        When to use: Use when runners are near the middle or trying to sneak through gaps.</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t Chase Too Far</strong><br>
    	How to do it: Stay close to your line. Only stretch out a bit to tag—don’t leave big gaps.<br>
        When to use: Use when runners are trying to bait you into moving off-position.</li>
    </ul> <br>

    <h3>HISTORY OF PATINTERO</h3>

    </div>
    <p>Patintero, also known as harangang-taga or tubigan, is a traditional Filipino children's game. Furthermore, it is derived from Spanish word tinte which means “tint" or "ink" in reference to the drawn lines. Another name for it is tubigan, tubiganay, or tubig-tubig ("water [game]"), because the grid lines are also commonly drawn by wetting the ground with water. It is also known as harangang-taga or harang-taga which means "block and catch", referring to the game mechanics. It is also the most widely played native game in the Philippines.</p>
